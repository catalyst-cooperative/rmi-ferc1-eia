This repository will be used to collaborate with RMI in translating some of
their FERC Form 1 and EIA data integrations from Excel into Python. This will
allow the process to scale to all the years of available data, and make the
data linkages reproducible and re-usable.

For now this will primarily be a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that rely on PUDL.

Below is a visual overview of the main processes in this repo:
